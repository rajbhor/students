<h1>Refund Policy</h1>
<strong>Cancelling an Order</strong> <br />
<p>While  there is no option for you to cancel the order on your own once the payment is  made, you can get in touch with us as soon as possible with your order number.  As long as your order has not been processed, we can cancel it and refund your  amount. If you cancel your order before the product has shipped, you can choose  to have the entire amount refunded or get a DU voucher.<br />
  Once  request of cancellation of item(s) is received, it will take us a maximum of 15  – 21&nbsp; business days to cancel the order and initiate refund.  Candidate&nbsp; will be&nbsp; notified of when the cancellation is initiated by  us. The actual crediting of the refund amount will depend on the refund mode  (cheque / electronic) and bank’s processing times.<br />
  <strong>Refunds</strong> <br />
  Any  refund claim will be processed after receipt of the product by us or after we  establish the goods sold by us did not conform to the Standards. Refund will be  processed based on the mode of payment of the order:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
  <li>Orders paid by credit/debit card will be refunded by credit back  to the credit/debit card within 7 working days. The actual crediting of the  refund amount will depend on the bank’s processing times.</li>
  <li>Orders paid by net banking accounts will be credited back to bank  account. The actual crediting of the refund amount will depend on the bank’s  processing times.</li>
  <li>For all other modes of payment, we will send a refund cheque. The  cheque will be made in favour of the name as in the &quot;billing name&quot;  provided at the time of placing the order.</li>
